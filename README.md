## <a name="des">Description</a>
<p> For Module 13 of SMU Web Dev Class. 
<br>User Story: AS A manager at an internet retail company<br>
I WANT a back end for my e-commerce website that uses the latest technologies<br>
SO THAT my company can compete with other e-commerce companies<br><br>
<br>Requirements:GIVEN a functional Express.js API
<br>WHEN I add my database name, MySQL username, and MySQL password to an environment variable file
<br>THEN I am able to connect to a database using Sequelize
<br>WHEN I enter schema and seed commands
<br>THEN a development database is created and is seeded with test data
<br>WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
<br>THEN my server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to the MySQL database
<br>WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia for categories, products, or tags
<br>THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
<br>WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia
<br>THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete data in my database


## <a name="ins">Installation</a>
<p>Please download repo. Use "npm run seed" to insert seed data into the database and then "npm start" to initiate the api. Use Insomnia to make all the calls.</p><br>


## <a name="use">Usage</a>
<p> Use so that you may get, pull, post and delete items from the database. NOTE: There are a few "post" actions that claim they do not work but, upon looking at the database, you will find them within.</p><br>
